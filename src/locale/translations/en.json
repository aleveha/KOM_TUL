The laboratory aims to create a range of comprehensive services, especially in measuring lengths and angles (1D, 2D, 3D). It is also equipped for accurate measurement of surface roughness parameters by touch method according to ČSN EN ISO 4287 and other standards. For non-contact measurement of surface roughness parameters, the laboratory is equipped with a confocal microscope and a 3D laser non-contact profilometer. Part of the offer is the analysis of the surface layer's properties by a digital Barkhausen noise analyzer. The laboratory is equipped with a thermomechanical analyzer for measuring the physical quantities of solids.",
